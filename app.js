/* The four rules for 'this';
* in your own words. explain the four rules for the "this" keyword below.
* 1. When you have 'this' inside a function in a global scope; its value will be the window object
* 2. On functions called by a preceding dot; the object before the dot is 'this'
* 3. 'this' points to an instance of an object when uusing a constructor function
* 4. 'this' can be explicitly defined when using the call or apply method
* write out a code example of each explanation above
*/

// First Rule
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  console.log(, this);
}
console.log(, this);
conosle.log('greet', greet('Allan'));
// Second Rule

// Third Rule

// Fourth Rule * you may want to use your third rule's example to accomplish this

// explain closure 

function foo () {
  console.log(this); // what does this point to?
};

const counterFunction = () => {
  // this code is broken. figure out why, and tell us where the closure is when you fix it
  const changeCount = (value) => {
    count += value;
  };
  return {
    increment: () => {
      changeCount(1);
    },
    decrement: () => {
      changeCount(-1);
    },
    total: () => {
      return count;
    }
  }
};
const counter = counterFunction();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.total());


// create a constructor function called "Car"
  // car takes an options object as its only argument
  // your options object should have "make", "model", "year" properties on it
  // assign these properties you pass in with options to the constructors 'this' object.
  // add a speak() method to your object that when called will log out the car's make model and year.

// when you're done un comment the next few lines and run the file here in node `node app.js`.

// const herby = new Car({make: 'Volkswagen', model: 'Beetle', year: '1963'});
// console.log(herby.speak());
// const goldfinger = new Car({make: 'Aston Martin', model: 'DB5', year: '1964'});
// console.log(goldfinger.speak());


// once you get done with this, redo it all using the class keyword and a constructor function. 

// extra credit

// we didn't touch on Recursion in the lecture yet, but you're going to build a recursive function now


let n = 10;
while(n >= 1) {
  console.log(n);
  n--;
}
// write a function called countDown that does the exact same thing as above, but calls itself until it can't anymore.
  // hint-> your base case will look like the logic in the while loop.
